# Classification of Bird Species Based on Their Sounds Using Neural Networks  

This project applies neural networks to classify bird species based on their vocalizations, using data from the Birdcall competition dataset on Xeno-Canto. Both binary classification distinguishing between two species and multi-class classification identifying one of 12 species tasks were performed using spectrograms generated from audio recordings. The neural network models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), demonstrated high effectiveness, achieving up to 100% accuracy in both classification tasks. Techniques such as Fourier transforms, spectrogram generation, and one-hot encoding were employed for data preprocessing, while model architectures were optimized through hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, external test data were analyzed to validate model performance. The findings highlight the potential of neural networks in bioacoustic classification, providing valuable insights for ornithological research, conservation efforts, and biodiversity monitoring. Further advancements in this domain can explore larger datasets, improved architectures, and enhanced computational efficiency to broaden practical applications.
